The USPS web API does not allow scripting by default. I doubt that I will be granted access to Web Tools scripting, so I created this project to scrape their website instead.
>Note: The United States Postal Service expressly prohibits the use of Web Tools "scripting" 
without prior approval. Web Tools scripting can be defined as a technique to generate large 
volumes of Web Tools XML request transactions that are database- or batch-driven under 
program control, instead of being driven by individual user requests from a web site or a client 
software package. The USPS reserves the right to suspend server access without notification by 
any offending party that does not have prior approval for Web Tools scripting. Registered Web 
Tools customers that believe they have a legitimate requirement for Web Tools scripting should 
contact the ICCC to request approval.
